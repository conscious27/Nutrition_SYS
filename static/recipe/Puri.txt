Ingredients:

2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp oil
3/4 cup warm water
Oil, for deep-frying
Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, salt, and oil.
2. Gradually add the warm water and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and soft. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 15-20 minutes.
3. Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls.
4. Roll each ball into a circle about 4-5 inches in diameter.
5. Heat oil in a deep pan over medium-high heat.
6. Once the oil is hot, gently slide the rolled puri into the oil.
7. Press the puri lightly with the back of a slotted spoon so that it puffs up.
8. Flip the puri over and cook the other side until it turns golden brown.
9. Remove the puri from the oil using a slotted spoon and place it on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
10. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.
11. Serve hot with potato curry or chana masala.
