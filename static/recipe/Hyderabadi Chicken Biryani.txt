Ingredients:

500 grams chicken
3 cups basmati rice
1 cup fried onions
1 cup yogurt
2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
2 teaspoons red chili powder
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon garam masala powder
1/2 cup chopped mint leaves
1/2 cup chopped coriander leaves
2-3 green chilies, slit
Salt to taste
1/2 cup ghee
Saffron strands, soaked in milk
Fried cashews and raisins for garnish

Instructions:

Step 1: Wash and soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.
Step 2: Marinate the chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, and salt for at least 2 hours.
Step 3: In a deep-bottomed pan, add ghee and fry the onions until golden brown. Remove the fried onions from the pan and set them aside.
Step 4: In the same pan, add the marinated chicken and cook until it's tender and the water dries up. Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside.
Step 5: In a large pot, boil 6 cups of water, add salt and the soaked rice. Cook the rice until it's 3/4th done. Drain the rice and set it aside.
Step 6: In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer the rice and chicken alternately. Add fried onions, chopped mint leaves, chopped coriander leaves, green chilies, and saffron-soaked milk on each layer.
Step 7: Cover the pot with a lid and place it on a tawa (griddle) on low heat for about 20-30 minutes.
Step 8: Once the biryani is done, garnish it with fried cashews and raisins.
Step 9: Serve hot with raita or salan.
