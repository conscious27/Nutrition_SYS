Ingredients:

2 cups chickpea flour (besan)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp red chili powder
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 cup water
2 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 green chili, finely chopped
1 tsp grated ginger
1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves

Oil for frying
Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, add chickpea flour, salt, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin seeds, and baking soda. 2. Mix well.
3. Gradually add water to the bowl, whisking continuously to make a smooth batter.
4. In another mixing bowl, add mashed potatoes, chopped onion, green chili, grated ginger, chopped coriander leaves, and salt to taste. Mix well.
5. Take a small portion of the potato mixture, shape it into a ball, and dip it in the chickpea flour batter to coat evenly.
6. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the coated potato ball to the oil and fry until golden brown.
