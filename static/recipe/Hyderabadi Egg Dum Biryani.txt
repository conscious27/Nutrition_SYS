For Layering:

1/2 cup fried onions
1/4 cup chopped mint leaves
1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves
1/4 tsp saffron strands, soaked in 2 tbsp milk
2 tbsp ghee

Instructions:

1. Boil the eggs: Place the eggs in a pot and cover them with water. Add the salt and turmeric powder and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the eggs from the pot and let them cool. Once cooled, peel the eggs and set aside.

2. Prepare the biryani masala: Heat the ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside. To the remaining onions in the pan, add the cumin seeds, fennel seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Fry for 30 seconds.

3. Add the yogurt, red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and garam masala to the pan. Mix well and cook for 5 minutes until the masala is cooked and the oil starts to separate.

4. Prepare the rice: Wash the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes. In a pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and ghee. Drain the water from the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook the rice on low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for 5 minutes.

5. Assemble the biryani: Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. In a baking dish, layer the boiled eggs on the bottom. Pour half of the biryani masala over the eggs. Add a layer of rice on top of the masala. Sprinkle half of the fried onions, mint leaves, cilantro leaves, and saffron milk over the rice. Repeat the layering process with the remaining masala, rice, fried onions, mint leaves, cilantro leaves, and saffron milk. Pour the remaining ghee on top.

6. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes until the top is lightly browned.

7. Serve the egg dum biryani hot with raita or a side salad.
