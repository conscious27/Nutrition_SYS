Ingredients:

4-6 fish fillets (any white fish like tilapia, cod, or halibut)
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp black pepper powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp olive oil
Lemon wedges for garnish
Instructions:

1. In a bowl, mix lemon juice, black pepper powder, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder to make a marinade.
2. Place the fish fillets in the marinade and coat well. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes.
3. In a shallow bowl, mix flour and cornstarch together.
4. Take each fish fillet out of the marinade and coat it with the flour-cornstarch mixture. Shake off any excess flour.
5. Heat olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
Place the coated fish fillets in the pan and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and crispy.
6. Remove the fish fillets from the pan and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to remove any excess oil.
7. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve hot.
