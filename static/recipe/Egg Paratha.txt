Ingredients:

2 cups whole wheat flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp red chili powder
1 tsp cumin powder
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
2 tbsp oil
Water as needed
2 eggs
1 small onion, chopped
1 green chili, chopped
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp red chili powder
1/4 tsp cumin powder
1 tbsp oil

Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour, salt, red chili powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, and oil. Mix everything well.

2. Add water slowly and knead into a smooth dough. The dough should not be too hard or too soft. Cover the dough and keep it aside for 10-15 minutes.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs along with the chopped onion, green chili, salt, red chili powder, and cumin powder.

4. Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a ball. Flatten the ball and roll it out into a small circle.

5. Add a spoonful of the egg mixture on top of the circle and spread it evenly.

6. Fold the edges of the dough to the center, covering the egg mixture. Seal the edges by pinching them together.

7. Gently roll out the stuffed dough ball into a paratha.

8 .Heat a pan on medium-high heat and add a little oil. Place the rolled-out paratha on the pan and cook until the bottom side is golden brown.

9. Flip the paratha and cook the other side until it is also golden brown.

10. Serve hot with your favorite chutney or curry.
