Ingredients:

3-4 karela (bitter gourd), sliced
1 onion, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
1 tsp cumin seeds (jeera)
1 tsp coriander powder (dhaniya)
1/2 tsp turmeric powder (haldi)
1/2 tsp red chili powder (lal mirch)
Salt to taste
2 tbsp oil
Coriander leaves for garnishing
Instructions:

1. Wash the karela and slice them thinly.
2. Sprinkle salt on the karela slices and keep them aside for 30 minutes. This will remove the bitterness from the karela. Squeeze out the water from the karela slices and discard the water.
3. Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds.
4. Once the cumin seeds crackle, add chopped onion and fry until golden brown.
5. Add chopped tomato and cook for 2-3 minutes.
6. Add the karela slices, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt to taste. Mix well.
7. Cover the pan with a lid and let the karela cook on a low flame for 10-15 minutes.
Stir occasionally to avoid sticking to the bottom of the pan.
8. Once the karela is cooked, garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with roti or rice.
