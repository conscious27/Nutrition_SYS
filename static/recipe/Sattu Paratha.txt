Ingredients:

1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup water
1 cup roasted gram flour (sattu)
1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped
2 green chilies, finely chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
1 tsp grated ginger
1/2 tsp ajwain seeds
1/2 tsp cumin powder
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
Salt, to taste
Ghee (clarified butter) or oil, for frying
Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt.
2. Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth dough. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 10-15 minutes.
3. In another bowl, mix the sattu, chopped onion, green chilies, chopped fresh coriander, grated ginger, ajwain seeds, cumin powder, turmeric powder, and salt.
4. Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.
5. Dust the rolling surface with some flour and roll out one ball into a circle about 4-5 inches in diameter.
6. Place a spoonful of the sattu mixture in the center of the circle and bring the edges together to seal the filling.
7. Flatten the stuffed ball with your palm and dust it with flour.
8. Roll out the stuffed ball into a circle about 6-7 inches in diameter, dusting with flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
9. Heat a tawa or griddle over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the rolled paratha on the tawa and cook for 1-2 minutes or until small bubbles appear on the surface.
10. Flip the paratha over and spread some ghee or oil on top. Flip again and spread ghee or oil on the other side as well.
11. Cook the paratha until both sides are golden brown, pressing gently with a spatula to ensure even cooking.
12. Serve hot with yogurt, pickle, or any chutney of your choice.
