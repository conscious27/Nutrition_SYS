Ingredients:

1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup water
1 tbsp vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)
Extra flour for dusting
Extra oil or ghee for cooking
Instructions:

1. 1In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour and salt. Mix well.
2. Slowly add the water to the flour mixture while kneading the dough. Knead for 5-7 minutes until it forms a smooth and pliable dough.
3. Divide the dough into equal-sized balls.
4. Take one dough ball and roll it out into a flat circle of about 6 inches in diameter.
5. Brush the circle with oil or ghee, sprinkle a little flour on top, and fold the circle in half.
6. Brush the half-circle with oil or ghee, sprinkle a little flour on top, and fold it in half again to form a triangle.
7. Roll the triangle out into a flat paratha of about 6 inches in diameter.
8. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
9. Place the rolled-out paratha on the pan and cook for about 30 seconds or until small bubbles start to form.
10. Flip the paratha and cook for another 30 seconds or until brown spots appear.
11. Brush the paratha with oil or ghee on both sides and cook for another 30 seconds or until fully cooked.
12. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.
