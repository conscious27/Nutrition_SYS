Ingredients:

2 eggs
1 tablespoon butter or oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional: fillings such as cheese, diced vegetables, ham, etc.

Instructions:

1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together with a fork. Add salt and pepper to taste.
2. Heat the butter or oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
3. Once the butter or oil is hot, pour the whisked eggs into the skillet and use a spatula to spread them evenly across the surface of the skillet.
4. If using fillings, sprinkle them onto one half of the omelette.
5. Use the spatula to fold the other half of the omelette over the fillings, creating a half-moon shape.
6. Cook the omelette for about 2-3 minutes, until the bottom is golden brown.
7. Use the spatula to carefully flip the omelette over and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side.
8. Once the omelette is fully cooked, use the spatula to transfer it to a plate and serve hot. Enjoy!
