Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, add the all-purpose flour, vegetable oil, and salt. Mix well.

3. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, prepare the filling by soaking the yellow split peas in water for 1-2 hours.
5. Drain the water from the split peas and grind them in a food processor or blender to form a coarse paste.
6. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a pan and add cumin seeds, red chili powder, and turmeric powder. Mix well.
7. Add the split pea paste to the pan and saut√© for 5-7 minutes until it becomes slightly dry.
8. Add salt to taste and mix well. Remove from heat and let it cool down.
9. Divide the dough into equal-sized balls.
10. Roll out each ball into a small disc using a rolling pin.
11. Add 1-2 tbsp of the filling mixture in the center of the disc.
12. Bring the edges of the disc together and seal them by twisting them together.
13. Flatten the stuffed dough ball gently and roll it out into a small circle using a rolling pin.
14. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
15. Once the oil is hot, gently slide the kachori into the oil and fry until it becomes golden brown on both sides.
16. Drain the excess oil on a paper towel.
