Ingredients:

4 medium-sized potatoes, boiled and mashed
1 cup gram flour (besan)
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1/2 tsp red chili powder
Salt to taste
Oil for frying
4 Pav buns
4-5 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 inch ginger, grated
2-3 green chilies, finely chopped
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
1/2 tsp cumin seeds
A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
Salt to taste
Mint chutney (optional)
Instructions:

1. In a bowl, mix together mashed potatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Divide the mixture into 8-10 equal parts and shape them into small balls.
2. In a separate bowl, mix gram flour with salt, turmeric powder, and red chili powder. Add water as required to form a smooth batter.
3. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Dip each potato ball in the gram flour batter and carefully drop it into the hot oil. Fry until the balls turn golden brown in color. Drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
4. Heat oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. When they start to splutter, add garlic, ginger, green chilies, and asafoetida. Saute for a few seconds.
5. Cut the Pav buns horizontally into half and toast them in the same pan.
6. Spread mint chutney on one side of the Pav bun (optional). Place one fried potato ball on the bun and press it slightly. Cover it with the other half of the bun.
7. Serve hot with more mint chutney and fried green chilies (optional).
