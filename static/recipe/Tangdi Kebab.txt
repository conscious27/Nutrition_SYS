Ingredients:

6 chicken drumsticks
1/2 cup plain yogurt
2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
1 tbsp red chili powder
1 tbsp coriander powder
1 tsp cumin powder
1 tsp garam masala
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
2 tbsp lemon juice
Salt to taste
2 tbsp oil
Chopped cilantro for garnish
Instructions:

1. Wash and clean the chicken drumsticks. Pat them dry with a paper towel.
2. In a mixing bowl, add plain yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, turmeric powder, lemon juice, salt, and oil. Mix well.
3. Add the chicken drumsticks to the bowl and mix them with the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
4. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
5. Grease a baking dish with oil or line it with aluminum foil.
6. Take the chicken drumsticks out of the marinade and place them on the baking dish. Reserve the remaining marinade.
7. Bake the chicken drumsticks for 30-35 minutes or until they are cooked through.
8. In a pan, add the reserved marinade and cook on medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until it thickens.
9. Once the chicken drumsticks are done, brush them with the thickened marinade and broil for 5-7 minutes until they are nicely charred.
10. Serve hot with chopped cilantro for garnish.
