Ingredients:

500g boneless chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 cup cornflour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp ginger-garlic paste
1 tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp garam masala powder
1 tsp cumin powder
Salt, to taste
1 egg
Oil, for deep frying
Curry leaves, for garnish
Lemon wedges, for serving
Instructions:

1. In a bowl, mix together cornflour, all-purpose flour, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, and salt.
2. Add egg and mix well. The mixture should be thick and sticky.
3. Add chicken pieces to the mixture and mix well, so that each piece is coated well with the mixture.
4. In a deep frying pan or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat.
5. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the chicken pieces in batches and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy.
6. Remove the chicken from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.
7. Garnish with curry leaves and serve hot with lemon wedges.
