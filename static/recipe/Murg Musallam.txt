Ingredients:

1 whole chicken, cleaned and skin removed
2 cups yogurt
1/4 cup ghee or vegetable oil
2 large onions, finely sliced
2 tbsp ginger paste
2 tbsp garlic paste
2 tsp red chili powder
2 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp garam masala powder
Salt, to taste
1 cup water
Fresh coriander leaves, for garnishing
Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt.
2. Make incisions on the chicken with a sharp knife, and add it to the bowl. Rub the marinade all over the chicken, making sure to get it into the incisions. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
4. In a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
5. Add the marinated chicken to the pot along with any leftover marinade. Sauté the chicken until it turns golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes.
6. Add 1 cup of water to the pot and bring it to a boil. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Bake for 45-60 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.
7. Remove the pot from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before garnishing with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with rice or naan.
