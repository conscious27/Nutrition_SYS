Ingredients:

1 whole chicken, cut into pieces
1 cup plain yogurt
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 tablespoon cumin powder
1 tablespoon coriander powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
Salt to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic paste, ginger paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, paprika, garam masala, turmeric powder, and salt until well combined.
2. Add the chicken pieces to the bowl and mix well, making sure that each piece is coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.
3. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly grease it with vegetable oil.
4. Arrange the chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is crispy and browned. You can also grill the chicken over medium-high heat for 10-12 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.
5. Serve hot with naan bread, sliced onions, and lemon wedges.
