Ingredients:

500g fish (preferably a firm-fleshed fish like kingfish or tilapia)
1 onion, finely chopped
1 tomato, finely chopped
2-3 green chillies, slit lengthwise
1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp cumin powder
1 tsp garam masala powder
1 tsp mustard seeds
1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
2-3 dried red chillies
1/4 cup coconut milk
Salt, to taste
2 tbsp oil
Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)
Instructions:

1. Clean and cut the fish into medium-sized pieces. Rub some salt and turmeric powder onto the fish pieces and set aside.
2. Heat oil in a large pan or kadhai. Add mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds and dried red chillies. Fry until mustard seeds splutter and the chillies turn dark.
3. Add the chopped onions and green chillies, sauté until the onions are soft and translucent.
4. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.
5. Add the chopped tomatoes, red chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Cook for 4-5 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and pulpy.
6. Add 1-2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Let the gravy simmer for 5-7 minutes until it thickens slightly.
7. Add the fish pieces to the gravy, gently stir and cook for another 5-7 minutes until the fish is cooked through.
8. Add coconut milk and garam masala powder, gently stir and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
9. Turn off the heat and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
10. Serve hot with steamed rice.
