Ingredients:

1 cup besan (gram flour)
1/2 tsp red chili powder
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
1/2 tsp cumin powder
1/2 tsp coriander powder
1/4 tsp ajwain (carom seeds)
Salt to taste
1 large onion, thinly sliced
Oil for deep-frying
Water as needed
Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine besan, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, ajwain, and salt. Mix well.
2. Add water little by little and whisk to make a smooth batter with a thick consistency.
3. Add sliced onions to the batter and mix well to coat them evenly.
4. Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat.
5. Drop spoonfuls of the onion-besan mixture into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
6. Fry the pakoras until golden brown and crispy.
Remove them using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.
8. Serve the pakoras hot with your favorite chutney or dipping sauce.
