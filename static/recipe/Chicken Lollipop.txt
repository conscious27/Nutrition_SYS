Ingredients:

500g chicken drumettes
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon red chili powder
1 tablespoon coriander powder
1 tablespoon cumin powder
1 tablespoon garam masala powder
1 tablespoon corn flour
Salt to taste
Oil for deep frying
Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, mix the chicken drumettes with ginger-garlic paste, soy sauce, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, corn flour, and salt. Make sure the chicken pieces are coated evenly with the mixture.
2. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.
3. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
4. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated chicken drumettes to the pan, and fry them until they turn golden brown and are cooked through, which should take around 8-10 minutes.
5. Once done, use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken lollipops from the oil and place them on a paper towel to drain the excess oil.
6. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.
