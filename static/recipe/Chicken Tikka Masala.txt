500 g chicken breast, boneless and skinless, cut into bite-sized pieces
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon ginger paste
1 tablespoon garlic paste
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped
2 teaspoons tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon garam masala

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt. Mix well.

6. Add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste to the skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the tomatoes have softened and the mixture has thickened.
7. Add the garam masala and stir to combine.
8. Add the cooked chicken to the skillet and stir to coat the chicken in the tomato mixture.
9. Pour in the heavy cream and stir to combine. Simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.
