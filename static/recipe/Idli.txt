Ingredients:

2 cups idli rice
1 cup urad dal (skinned black gram)
1 tsp fenugreek seeds
Salt to taste
Water for soaking and grinding
Oil for greasing the idli molds
Instructions:

1. Rinse the idli rice and urad dal separately and soak them in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.
2. Rinse fenugreek seeds and add them to the urad dal while soaking.
3. Drain the water from the rice and grind it in a blender with enough water to make a smooth paste. Do not add too much water.
4. Drain the water from the urad dal and grind it in a blender with enough water to make a smooth and fluffy batter. The batter should be airy and light.
5. Mix the rice and urad dal batter together, add salt and mix well. The consistency of the batter should be thick and smooth.
6. Keep the batter in a warm place and let it ferment for at least 6-8 hours. The batter should double in volume and become airy and light.
7. Grease the idli molds with oil and pour the batter into each mold, filling them halfway.
8. Steam the idlis in a steamer for 10-12 minutes or until they are cooked. To check if they are cooked, insert a toothpick or knife into the idlis and check if it comes out clean.
9. Remove the idlis from the steamer and let them cool for a minute or two.
10. Use a spoon or knife to gently remove the idlis from the molds.
11. Serve hot with sambar and coconut chutney.
