Ingredients:

2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp sugar
1/4 cup yogurt
1/2 cup warm milk
2 tbsp oil
Butter, for brushing
Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.
2. Add the yogurt, warm milk, and oil to the flour mixture.
3. Mix well and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside for 2-3 hours.
4. Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls.
5. Dust the rolling surface with some flour and roll out each ball into a circle about 6-7 inches in diameter.
6. Heat a tawa or griddle over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the rolled kulcha on the tawa and cook for 1-2 minutes or until small bubbles appear on the surface.
7. Flip the kulcha over and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes.
8. Brush with butter and serve hot with curry or chutney of your choice.
