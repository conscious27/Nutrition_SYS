Ingredients:

1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup water
Salt, to taste
1 tbsp vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)
Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour and salt. Mix well.
2. Slowly add the water to the flour mixture while kneading the dough. Knead for 5-7 minutes until it forms a smooth and pliable dough.
3. Divide the dough into equal-sized balls.
Roll each ball out into a flat circle of about 6 inches in diameter.
4. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
5. Place the rolled-out roti on the pan and cook for about 30 seconds or until small bubbles start to form.
6. Flip the roti and cook for another 30 seconds or until brown spots appear.
7. Brush the roti with oil or ghee on both sides and cook for another 30 seconds or until fully cooked.
8. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.
