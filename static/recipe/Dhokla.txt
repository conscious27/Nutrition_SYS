Ingredients:

1 cup gram flour (besan)
1/4 cup semolina (sooji)
1/4 cup yogurt
1/2 tsp ginger paste
1 tsp green chili paste
Salt, to taste
1 tsp Eno fruit salt
1/2 cup water
1 tbsp oil
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
A pinch of asafoetida
1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves
Instructions:

1. In a mixing bowl, add gram flour, semolina, yogurt, ginger paste, green chili paste, and salt. Mix well.
2. Add water to the mixing bowl and mix until the batter is smooth and lump-free.
3. Cover the mixing bowl and set it aside for 15 minutes to ferment.
4. Grease a dhokla plate or any steaming container with oil.
5. Add Eno fruit salt to the batter and mix gently. The batter will become light and frothy.
6. Pour the batter into the greased plate and steam it for 15-20 minutes on medium heat until cooked.
7. Insert a toothpick into the center of the dhokla to check if it is cooked. If the toothpick comes out clean, the dhokla is cooked.
8. Remove the dhokla from the plate and cut it into desired shapes.
9. Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds. Once they start spluttering, add asafoetida and pour the tempering over the dhokla.
10. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve with green chutney or tamarind chutney.
